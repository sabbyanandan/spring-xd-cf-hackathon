======================

Spring XD based data-driven dynamic deployments of CF apps.

Idea
----
You have Apps running in CF and you'd like to automatically scale them based on demand. A demand can be throughput based or may be derived from metrics or perhaps you would want to automatically adjust sclaing based on a certain day/time (ex: Thanksgiving, Christmas, ..)

Spring XD fits perfectly for this requirement and the OOTB [source|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Sources] and [sink|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Sinks] modules could assist operationalizing data-driven dynamic deployments. To the most part you can get this up and running OOTB and zero coding needed! Following are few sample approaches to this.

* Measure the throughput based on CPU/Data transfer rates via logs/events generated by Apps within a time-window. Let those events consumed by Spring XD through 'HTTP' source module.
* Measure the API activities by routing the events to a pub/sub broker like 'Kafka' or 'Rabbit' and have Spring XD consume from them directly.
* Trigger the scaling protocol based on a timed-event through 'Trigger' source module

Sample Streams
--------------

|Stream Type | Stream Definition
|------|--------
HTTP Stream | stream create httpstream --definition "http | transform --script=postRequest.groovy | log" --deploy
Trigger Stream | stream create --name triggerstream --definition "trigger --date='11/25/14 17:22:00' | transform --script=postRequest.groovy | counter" --deploy
Rabbit Stream | stream create --name rabbitstream --definition "rabbit --queues='scale-out' | transform --script=postRequest.groovy | counter" --deploy
